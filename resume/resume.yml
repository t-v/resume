        My main function is to lead a DevOps competence center. DevOps evokes thoughts of hip and trendy
        new tools which we utilized to show how much easier life can be with fail/fool-proof automating of
        even the most insignificant task. However, just as important is shifting the mindset to have a more
        continuous workflow while pushing people to take co-ownership and responsibility within a project.
        By looking at each task from a service perspective, we aim to get more continuity and stability in the work we deliver.

        System Enabling is a very diverse team with a lot of requirements.
        My main purpose here was to add more Agile/DevOps practices and rituals
        to the daily routine. One of the big projects I carried during my short
        time here was to start using a GitOps deployment flow. This was
        resolved by introducing ArgoCD with Helm combined with automated build and
        promotion pipelines in Jenkins.

        loops. However, this compromise was necessary to guarantee the longevity of our
        product in meeting the needs of their future workload.

        TVH is in the middle of a major migration in the cloud which brings a lot of new and unexplored
        challenges for them. My main influence here was to ease the transition and help move the small chunks
        (microservices) that they were detaching from their old progress monolith. One of the biggest challenges
        here was to give everyone enough room to fully execute their tasks in individual work environments while
        making sure the whole is fully protected from internal and external threats. Another large part of my role
        was coaching people in the merits of adopting the DevOps philosophy. This was the perfect moment to introduce
        the concepts of Infrastructure-as-Code to show that a decade of one way is not a solid reason to deny more efficient means.

      summary: |
        My job here was multi-faceted. I managed the architectural designs, automation, and progression
        of the technical aspects while coaching colleagues and customers in transitioning to the DevOps way.
        The technical aspects were divided into two parts. The first half was working daily within the
        development environment. Their priority was producing content as fast and as stable as possible.
        My priority was to allow them the ability to focus on development by bringing them easy to use
        tooling and an abstraction layer they felt comfortable using. This was accomplished through pipeline
        optimization, ease of configuration, and adapting new services and pipelines on a Kubernetes environment
        that would empower the developers. My other role was as part of an operations team. It functioned as a
        service which maintained and managed the infrastructure for various development teams within Cegeka in
        an Infrastructure-as-Code fashion. Through this, we designed and executed the requirements of the external
        and internal customers on our infrastructure.

        We had to migrate from the old infrastructure to the new infrastructure. The goal was to fully
        automate and stabilize because we were responsible for the whole stack—from maintaining firmware
        upgrades to deploying artifacts coming from the development teams. We were required to constantly
        test durability while maintaining a 96% uptime on the production environment. The best solution was
        to fully automate the chain allowing us to better stress-test the environment. This gave us the ability
        to better assess our current bottlenecks which provided valuable insight to make future improvements.

        Our main focus was to maintain customer environments mainly focused around transportation and accounting.
        We performed numerous cloud migrations to increase accessibility and guarantee a faster, more dynamic workplace
        setting. We completed various migrations to meet client needs. This ranged from exchange to Office365 to full
        cloud migrations. One such project was a fully redundant virtualized environment with fail-over that included
        migration from the old system to the new one with a connection to Office365. Another project was a cloud migration
        with only a local controller for authentication for the local desktops. This included full Office365 integration
        and inter site communication.
