          <td>Summary:</td><td>My main focus here was enabling customers in getting the SAS Viya suite installed and integrated in their current environment.
As an analytic platform it integrates with almost every dataset available in the company, which often requires a complex and well thought out architecture. This gets designed in cooperation with both the customer's business team as well as the customer's technical team and make sure their requirements and use cases align.
Once the architecture is approved and in place, I needed to support the engineers in getting the SAS software installed and help both the SAS- as the customer's team in getting the local datasets integrated in SAS.
Apart from my customer facing consulting tasks, there are also the pre-sales consulting tasks, in which I help pre-sales architects work out sturdier and more modern architectures to fit with the customer's demands. This often starts with me designing a small, simplified architecture of the final version and create a PoC to prove our capabilities to the customer.

continuous workflow while pushing people to take co-ownership and responsibility within a project.

          <td>Summary:</td><td>I was solely responsible for the technical coordination of the MyUCB project. This project's main purpose was to be the platform for patient <-> doctor interaction and to have the required feedback for the clinical studies.
As the platform is used for clinical studies, this also means the platform needs to be fully GxP validated before it can be released to the study as this uses confidential patient data.
As a Technical Coordinator my job had 3 very distinct parts.
The first one was as a scrum master/PO. This meant taking care of the DevOps backlog, making sure the agile rituals were followed and that the necessary stories were added to make sure progress was made into automating as much as possible.
The second part was about validation. We needed to have the platform GxP validated, which meant it was required to qualify installation, operation and performance. My job here was to run the IQ (installation qualification) and in the process, I would try to automate as much as possible of the manual steps. (As I prefer not to repeatedly do the same menial manual tasks.)
The third part was all about debugging and error detection. Due to having confidential patient data, this platform was designed without any output, to make sure none of the data can get leaked in stack traces. This required me to search blindly when errors occurred, and in turn lead me to create procedures and requests for more visibility in future tasks.

My main purpose here was to add more Agile/DevOps practices and rituals
to the daily routine. One of the big projects I carried during my short
time here was to start using a GitOps deployment flow. This was
resolved by introducing ArgoCD with Helm combined with automated build and
promotion pipelines in Jenkins.

here was to give everyone enough room to fully execute their tasks in individual work environments while
making sure the whole is fully protected from internal and external threats. Another large part of my role
was coaching people in the merits of adopting the DevOps philosophy. This was the perfect moment to introduce
the concepts of Infrastructure-as-Code to show that a decade of one way is not a solid reason to deny more efficient means.

of the technical aspects while coaching colleagues and customers in transitioning to the DevOps way.
The technical aspects were divided into two parts. The first half was working daily within the
development environment. Their priority was producing content as fast and as stable as possible.
My priority was to allow them the ability to focus on development by bringing them easy to use
tooling and an abstraction layer they felt comfortable using. This was accomplished through pipeline
optimization, ease of configuration, and adapting new services and pipelines on a Kubernetes environment
that would empower the developers. My other role was as part of an operations team. It functioned as a
service which maintained and managed the infrastructure for various development teams within Cegeka in
an Infrastructure-as-Code fashion. Through this, we designed and executed the requirements of the external
and internal customers on our infrastructure.

We performed numerous cloud migrations to increase accessibility and guarantee a faster, more dynamic workplace
setting. We completed various migrations to meet client needs. This ranged from exchange to Office365 to full
cloud migrations. One such project was a fully redundant virtualized environment with fail-over that included
migration from the old system to the new one with a connection to Office365. Another project was a cloud migration
with only a local controller for authentication for the local desktops. This included full Office365 integration
and inter site communication.
